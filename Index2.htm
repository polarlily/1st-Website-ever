My name is Tobenna Obi. I am 16 years old and live in Georgia, U.S.A.
I live with my brothers, cousins, aunt, mom and step-dad. It's a full house!
I am in the 11<sup>th</sup> grade and go to Grayson High School. I don't play
any sports, but I love to draw and write stories. <del>I hate anything
basketball or football</del>, but I love desserts. One fun fact about me is
that I'm a <str>pessimist</str>. I always see the glass half-empty!
